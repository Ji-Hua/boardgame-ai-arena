# boardgame-ai-arena

A modular training and evaluation platform for board game AI systems.

This project aims to provide a clean, extensible infrastructure for:

- Game engine integration  
- Self-play training  
- ELO-based evaluation  
- Agent benchmarking  
- Distributed experimentation  

The long-term goal is to build a reusable AI arena architecture that is not limited to a single game.

## Current Scope

Initial development focuses on:

- Turn-based board game environments  
- Deterministic engine core  
- Pluggable agent interfaces  
- Match orchestration and rating pipeline  

The architecture is designed to remain game-agnostic.
